# Kiu: YAPL

Kiu is a small, expressive, and minimalist programming language created as a personal passion project. 
My motivation is to build a language I would enjoy using while sharpening my skills in interpreter, parser, lexer, and compiler development. 
With a focus on simplicity, Kiu serves as a solid foundation for implementing and understanding core programming language concepts.
